we could add datasets by downloading it but we will write it ourselves using intents json file.
 creating a bunch of messages that the user is likely to type in and mapping them to a group of appropriate responses.
we will use this data by training a neural network to take a sentence of words and classify it as one of the tags in our file.
we bind the tags to action aka functions 
SpeechRecognition library has many classes 
Recognizer helps in convert audio files to text
tts is an instance engine that is text to speech 
runAndWait() â†’ None
Blocks while processing all currently queued commands. Invokes callbacks for engine notifications appropriately. Returns when all commands queued before this call are emptied from the queue.
we have to train a model that recognizes the intents and maps them to the functions to get out a an actionwe do this by using a libary called neural intents that has generic assistant as a class
